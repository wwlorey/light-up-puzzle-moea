\section{Introduction}

Assignment 1d involved implementing a Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithm (MOEA)
to more effectively solve Light Up puzzles by balancing the fulfillment of three
objectives: 

\begin{enumerate}

\item maximize the number of cells lit up (represented in this implementation
as a ratio of lit cells to the total number of white cells)

\item minimize the number of bulbs shining on each other

\item minimize the number of black cell adjacency constraint violations

\end{enumerate}

For BONUS \#1, a fourth objective was added, namely minimizing the number of bulbs
placed on the board.

This report outlines this solution's particular
implementation of a MOEA, the impact of initialization strategies on the MOEA's 
performance, a comparison between parent selection, survival strategy, and survival
selection strategies on MOEA performance, as well as the impact of increasing the
number of objectives on non-domination and MOEA performance (BONUS \#1).
